# Autonomous Boat Navigation System
## Overview
This repository documents the Ocean Cleaner, an autonomous boat designed for waste collection in aquatic environments. Developed as an academic project, it integrates mechanical engineering, ROS-based software, and hardware systems to enable autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and waste collection. Detailed documentation is provided in each subdirectory.
## Purpose

The project aims to:





Design a robust, hydrodynamic boat for aquatic environments.



Implement autonomous navigation using ROS Noetic and Gmapping for SLAM.



Integrate sensors (LIDAR, IMU, GPS, camera) and actuators for real-time operation.
## Key Components





Mechanical Design: A lightweight, watertight hull made of ABS plastic, optimized for minimal drag and stability.



ROS Software: Utilizes ROS Noetic with asv_wave_sim for simulation, Gmapping for mapping, and custom nodes for waste collection.



Hardware Integration: Combines Raspberry Pi 4, sensors, and motor control systems for autonomous functionality.
