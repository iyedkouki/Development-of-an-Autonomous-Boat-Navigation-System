# Mechanical Design for Autonomous Boat Navigation System

## Overview

This directory contains the mechanical design components for the Autonomous Boat Navigation System, developed as part of an end-of-studies project. The mechanical design encompasses the physical structure, hull design, and hardware integration for the autonomous boat, ensuring stability, durability, and functionality in various aquatic environments.

## Purpose

The mechanical design aims to:





Provide a robust and hydrodynamic hull to support autonomous navigation.



House and protect electronic components (e.g., sensors, motors, and control systems).



Ensure efficient propulsion and maneuverability.



Maintain stability and buoyancy under different water conditions.

## Components

The mechanical design includes the following key elements:





Hull Structure: A lightweight, watertight hull designed for minimal drag and optimal stability.



Mounting Systems: Brackets and enclosures for securing sensors, cameras, and communication modules.





Frame and Supports: Internal framework to distribute weight and maintain structural integrity.



Materials: ABS plastic.

## Design Details





Hull Design: The hull is modeled to reduce water resistance and enhance energy efficiency.
